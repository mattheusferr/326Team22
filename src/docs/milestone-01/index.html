                    <h3>Mattheus Ferreira</h3>
                    <p>With the education from highschool and UMass, I am experienced in java, javascript, C, C++, and SQL. I’ve completed all of my 200 level courses at UMass currently taking 326, 377(Operating Systems) and 325 (HCI). I have interest in data science and cybersecurity having work experience in the former (business intelligence, data validation). I believe my strongest skills revolve around critical thinking/problem solving while also being able to utilize diversity of thought and intrapersonal communication to effectively work in a collaborative environment. I am a huge basketball fan so for the last two years, 2 other students and I have been working on a project where we are creating our own statistical metric to grade professional and college players.</p>

                    <h3>Hari Iyer</h3>
                    <p>I’m familiar with Java, Javascript, and Typescript through UMass 200-level courses. Taking math and stats upper electives, I’ve become experienced with programming in R and using MATLAB. I am also proficient in Python, (research experiences and various projects) which has helped me become very comfortable with using libraries including NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. After beng a part of URV (Undergraduate Research Volunteer), I gained skills in data base management and SQL, which I used in designing and querying relational databases. Lastly, I am adept at front-end development using HTML, CSS, JS, and back-end development frameworks like Node.js and Express. Apart from computer science, I enjoy eating out and playing soccer.</p>

                    <h3>Vedant Ajwani</h3>
                    <p>Coded in Java in High School, I'll finish all the 200 level courses by the end of this semester and 326 is my first 300 lvl course. I’ve coded using React/typescript/html professionally. I’ve also participated in a few robotics competitions where we programmed our robot using java. I’m pretty good at problem solving and I’m mostly interested in AI and cybersecurity. Other than CS I'm interested in music and working out.</p>

                    <h3>Jayani Tripat</h3>
                    <p> I’m currently studying informatics with a concentration in Data Science along with a minor in Computer Science. So far, I have worked with Java,  SQL, C, html, R, and python. I am looking forward to learning more about web development.</p>
