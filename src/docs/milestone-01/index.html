            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A website that would allow students to connect with other students in the same classes as them, allowing them to make study groups, get help from other students who have already taken the class, let students who want to join this class get an insight on it and have any other form of discussion they would like to have related to this class. The website would also include a discussion forum where students could bring up matters related to the university in general.</p>
            <p>The student room features involve being public or private depending on the settings selected by the admin, room size and even discussion forums on specific topics about class.</p>
            <p>You could also book study rooms at the University Library or other study spaces on campus and would receive reminders about meetings you’ve booked with your peers.</p>
            <p>Another feature would include a page which has data about the S.I sessions and Office hours about the specific classes that you’ve selected and also allows you to book tutoring sessions provided by the university.</p>

            <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
            <p>Our application aims to facilitate connections among students sharing the same class, enabling them to form study groups and reserve campus rooms for collaborative learning sessions. In the college setting, it can be challenging to locate peers for study groups, particularly for students dealing with anxiety or lacking strong social skills. To address this issue and promote collaborative learning, our app provides an accessible platform for students to overcome barriers and study together effortlessly. Fostering positive relationships through group study is a vital skill that transcends into professional environments. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance of learning and connecting with peers in an educational setting has become more apparent than ever. Our application addresses a real-life problem and contributes to enhancing the educational experience.</p>

        <section id="integrative-experience">
            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <p>UStudy embodies the core principles of the Integrative Experience (IE), fusing educational insights from our coursework with a hands-on project that addresses a real-world challenge at UMass. Our team draws on knowledge from the CS326 web programming course to build a platform that connects students with study groups, enhancing both their academic and personal development.<br><br>
            Central to the IE is teamwork and communication, both key to the UStudy project. By working together, we are learning to combine our skills and viewpoints to build a useful and easy-to-use platform. This work mirrors real situations where diverse teams solve complex problems and helps us get better at discussing ideas, understanding different opinions, and explaining our work to a broad audience, which are important skills for the future.<br><br>
            Also, UStudy is a chance to use our problem-solving and critical thinking in a setting that cuts across different areas of study. We're challenged to think about how students interact and collaborate, pushing us to apply what we've learned in class to a project that aims to have a real impact.<br><br>
            Finally, UStudy is about learning together. It's a chance to apply what we've learned to a big issue — helping students succeed. The project shows us how our classes connect to the outside world, and it prepares us for a life of learning and facing challenges in society.

                    <h3>Mattheus Ferreira</h3>
                    <p>With the education from highschool and UMass, I am experienced in java, javascript, C, C++, and SQL. I’ve completed all of my 200 level courses at UMass currently taking 326, 377(Operating Systems) and 325 (HCI). I have interest in data science and cybersecurity having work experience in the former (business intelligence, data validation). I believe my strongest skills revolve around critical thinking/problem solving while also being able to utilize diversity of thought and intrapersonal communication to effectively work in a collaborative environment. I am a huge basketball fan so for the last two years, 2 other students and I have been working on a project where we are creating our own statistical metric to grade professional and college players.</p>

                    <p>I’m familiar with Java, Javascript, and Typescript through UMass 200-level courses. Taking math and stats upper electives, I’ve become experienced with programming in R and using MATLAB. I am also proficient in Python, (research experiences and various projects) which has helped me become very comfortable with using libraries including NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. After beng a part of URV (Undergraduate Research Volunteer), I gained skills in data base management and SQL, which I used in designing and querying relational databases. Lastly, I am adept at front-end development using HTML, CSS, JS, and back-end development frameworks like Node.js and Express. Apart from computer science, I enjoy eating out and playing soccer.</p>
